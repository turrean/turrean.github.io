							<h1>The Turrean </h1>
							<p class="major">-Irish Wolfhounds-<br>The Irish wolfhound is one of the oldest breeds in existence. It was developed by monks who needed an animal that could hunt down and kill wolves, which were considered dangerous pests at the time. The breed has been around for over 2,600 years and there are many tales of origin‚Ä¶

								The area of the "Helvetii" (meaning "the Helvetians") was part of CELTICA and bordered at Lake Constance, a lake that nowadays has been known as "Bodensee".  Today, three countries surround this lake: Austria, Germany, and Switzerland.  
								
								The "Helvetii" area was the part of CELTICA where the research indicates that Irish Wolfhounds first occurred.  Eventually, they moved with the Celtic tribes to the islands of Great Britain and eventually when the Celts invaded Ireland, the great hound--a mastiff type--arrived with them around 1699 BC.
								
								The modern breed was developed in the late 19th century. Rough and hard on the head, body and legs, beard and hair over eyes particularly wiry. They were historically famed as guardian dogs and for hunting wolves.
								
								Today still used as hunting dogs but also the Irish wolfhounds are gentle souls who love to get along with everyone and are especially good with children, and a friend to other dogs.</p>

							<h2>The History of Turrean</h2>
							<p>A beautiful woman who was transformed into the first large, white, shaggy Irish Wolfhound by a jealous faery queen named Uchtdealbh.  The spell had a flaw.  Not only did it turn Turrean into a dog, but quite literally, she became the most beautiful dog ever seen on earth.</p>

							<p>She was kept prisoner at Uchtdealbh's home in Galway Bay until her brother, the warrior chief Fionn MacCumhal, saved her and her two sons, Bran and Sceolan* (also, Sgeolan). Turrean's spell was broken, but the sons stayed in the shape of the dogs for the rest of their lives. Both Bran and Sceolan became heroes of Legends. </p>

							<h2>The Sons of Turrean</h2>
							<p>Clan Leader Finn's mother had a sister named Turrean. Iollan Eachtach, a chieftain of the Ulster Fianna, falls in love with Turrean. Finn promises to bring her to him so that they may marry. Uchtdealb of the Fair Breast, one of the Sidhe (faery queen), is not happy about the upcoming nuptials. She disguises herself as Finn's messenger and convinces Turrean that she is to accompany her to a great feast in the land beyond. Once in the woods, Uchtdealb takes out a hazel wand and changes Turrean, into a hound. Uchtdealb gives the beautiful animal to Fergus Fionnliath, a man who hates dogs. She tells him that the dog is a gift from Finn. The dog is pregnant and Uchtdealb tells Fergus that he might take the dog hunting, but he must refrain from doing so when the time for giving birth draws near. The hound turns out to be the best hunter ever.</p>

						<h2>THE STORY OF BRAN AND SCEOLAN</h2>
						<h4>(Sceolan, pronounced Sky-O-Lawn or Ska-Lawn)</h4>
						<p>It actually turns Fergus into a dog-lover. He does as instructed, and lets her rest as her time draws near. She gives birth to two puppies, which Fergus gives to Finn.  Finn names the dogs Bran and Sceolan, and like their mother, they are gifted hunters. There are many ancient legends about Bran and Sceolan, the most well-known tells of how they were able to recognize Fionn's future wife even though she had been transformed into a red deer.</p>

						<p>One day while hunting with warrior-chief Fionn, Bran and Sceolan came upon a beautiful red deer that the hounds refused to attack. Fionn allowed the deer to follow them back to the Dun, and when it passed through the gates, a mallachd (curse) was broken and she was transformed into a beautiful woman, Sabd, who became Fionn's wife. And it was also Bran and Sceolan who found Fionn's son, Oison, in the woods among the red deer herds after his wife had been stolen from him.</p>

						<h2>Ralph history with Turrean</h2>
						<p>I was born and raised in Germany and I have been always been fascinated by the commanding appearance and temperament of the ‚ÄúGentle Giant‚Äù‚Ä¶ the Irish Wolfhound.  However, it took me several years before I felt ready to take on the responsibility of living with an Irish Wolfhound. While still in Germany, I contacted Marisa Sarrazin of ‚ÄúIrish Wolfhounds von den Sarrazenen‚Äù (also see www.sarrazenen.de) and was united with my first Irish Wolfhound, Jason von den Sarrazenen. </p>

						<h2>Normal dog owner but cooler</h2>
						<p>Dedicated to continue my friend and mentor Marisa Sarrazin‚Äôs European champion lines, CH Dewin von den Sarrazenen joined our pack in 2011 along with Kionah von den Sarrazenen in 2014. In 2016 The Turrean welcomed its first litter (The ‚ÄúA‚Äù litter).

							In 2019 I met my then future wife and like myself she was a lover of giant breeds, since our coming together we have married and have welcomed 2 litters, today we currently reside with 3 generations-Kionah von den Sarrazenen, Aleena of The Turrean, GCH Bran of The Turrean, and Brienne of The Turrean.
